 I am most excited to learn about managing larger projects, such as the ones that will come up in this class and beyond. I also look forward to learning about data structures and algorithms (the main topic per the course title) as it is something that seems to be a huge focus in industry and interviews to work in the field. I am a bit apprehensive about the amount of work and time that this class necesitates but I look forward to strengthening my skills in regards to time management and efficiency with the projects and with studying the new material. I have struggled with getting lost, behind, and overwhelmed in classes in the past but through it all I have picked up new skills and techniques each time.
